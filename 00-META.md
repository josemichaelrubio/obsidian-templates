# Obsidian Templates

## Overview

This git repo holds my Obsidian templates. It is a continuous work-in-progress.

### Plugins
It requires the following plugins: 
- [Templater]([Introduction - Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/)) 
- [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) or core Daily Notes
- [Tasks.](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks)
- [Day Planner](https://github.com/ivan-lednev/obsidian-day-planner)
- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
- [Calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin)
## Templates
### Functional
Fully Functional, however, will continue to improve:
- [[_daily]]
- [[_weekly]]
- [[_monthly]]
- [[_dreams]]
- [[_quick]]
- [[_default]]

### In-Progress
Useable but requires more work:
- [[_quarterly]]
- [[_yearly]]

### To Do
- [[_5-year]]
- [[_areas]]
- [[_resources]]
- [[_projects]]
- [[_ideas]]
- All other folders

## Notes

[[2025-03-15]]
	- Plugin: May cut [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) = I don't know if I am using it since Templater takes care of the template destination (May the Plugin Tasks uses it)
	- Daily planner uses it. It needed the Daily core plugin, Periodic Notes replaces the Daily core plugin
	- Replaced - [Tasks.](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) with [Overview | Sync with Todoist Plugin](https://jamiebrynes7.github.io/obsidian-todoist-plugin/docs/overview) and https://github.com/Ledaryy/obsidian-todoist-completed-tasks for:
		- [[_daily]]

[[2025-05-10]]
- Removed todoist from [[_daily]]
	- Cause I used the app more

[[2025-07-13]]
- (1) [[_default]] takes care of any note that doesn't have a template, it has lowest priority, leaving other templates in charge of their respective folder 
- [[_quick]] now has a preset tag and related file, and it had a new property called source
